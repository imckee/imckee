1. What is the difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`?

2. Why is the "index" or "staging area" needed in git? Put another way, why do you use the command `git add`?

### Please post your answer here. Please use your own words and do it within 50 words for each question.

1.) `Git pull` is short for `git fetch`.  `Git pull` takes the changes made from a repository into a local branch. `Git fetch` downloads the objects and refts from another repository.   

2.) You use the command `git add` to add contents to an index.  If you made updates on a project and would like to push the latest progress to a repository, you use `git add`.  The `git add` command updates the project by replacing the previous push with your latest push.
