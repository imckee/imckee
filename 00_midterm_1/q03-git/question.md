### Question 3:

Please answer the following with maximum 50 words each (keep it short):

1. Give at least 2 reasons why git/github are useful for a solo developer.

2. Give at least 2 other reasons why git/github are useful to a team of developers.



### Please post your answer here:

1.) For a solo developer, git/github can provide several benefits because it provides the opportunity for them to showcase their work to other developers in the software industry.  Github can also help a developer keep track of their progress and save older code that may have worked previously.  

2.) Github can be useful to a team because Github allows the opportunity for teams to showcase their work to the public.  With Github, teams can also work virtually by creating a private repository.  The team does not have to be in the same physical location.
